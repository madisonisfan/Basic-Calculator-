# Recreating iOS calculator with Swift


For my first tutorial, I decided to recreate Apples' iOS calculator. I used Swift, along with SwiftUI. 

I started off with recreating the apperaance of the calcualtor, then I moved on to adding the funactionality of the buttons. I will soon be going through the project to see how I can improve it.
